This projects are implementation of fiat shamir zero knowledge protocol with client-server mode.
We also have trusted center, which takes two prime numbers multiplies them and writes result in file, file name is trust.txt
Both client and server read number(public key) from that file and start communicate with each other
Client must assure that he knows a secret.
